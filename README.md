# tipSkip MOD
tipSkip is a not-so-known app that can be used to skip, pause and play songs by knocking on the front or back of your phone.
"No headphones with remote? No problem! Just put the device in your pocket or on the table and use your hand or finger/s to knock on your device", quoted from the Google Store.

I created this module to add a few features to it:
-The splash screen lasts too long (2 sec), so it has been completely removed to load the actual app instantly.
-I never used The "Double Previous" button, so I changed its function to increase the volume, which I sometimes need.
-Last, an important feature that it should have had, the knocks only work if the screen is OFF! Why would I need to use the knocks if my screen is already on?

I'd like to thank @josephcsible from XDA for his help.
